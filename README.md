### For Applicants 

This project is an opportunity to showcase your skills and maturity in software design and development.
We will use the result of your project to evaluate the quality of your work and suitability for Deltager. This is not Pass/Fail test so please do what you can.

### Business Rules

This application is a simple e-commerce web app with the ability to buy any product.
It allows the user to pick a product from the products list and add it to the shopping cart, enter shipping and billing address as well as payment information required for order creation.

The checkout process consists of 3 steps: 
- Select Products to purchase from the Product catalog and enter its amount (At least one product in shopping cart required to proceed to next checkout step)
- Fill in Shipping/Billing info with possibility to prefill Billing info from Shipping info
- Fill in Payment info

### Task

The current code is legacy and requires refactoring/improvements to be production-ready. Your task requires: 
- refactoring of existing code according to the best coding practices to make it production-ready
- update of shopping cart logic so it will show the amount of products user is willing to buy (update of an indicator inside navbar)

**Good luck!**
